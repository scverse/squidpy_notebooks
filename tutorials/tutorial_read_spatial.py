Import spatial data in AnnData and Squidpy
==========================================

This tutorial shows how to store spatial datasets in :class:`anndata.AnnData`.

Spatial molecular data comes in many different formats, and to date there is no
one-size-fit-all solution for reading spatial data in Python.
Scanpy already provides a solution for Visium Spatial transcriptomics data with
the function :func:`scanpy.read_visium` but that is basically it.
Here in Squidpy, we do provide some pre-processed (and pre-formatted) datasets,
with the module :mod:`squidpy.datasets` but it's not very useful for the users
who need to import their own data.

In this tutorial, we will showcase how spatial data are stored in :class:`anndata.AnnData`.
We will use mock datasets for this purpose, yet showing with examples the important
details that you should take care of in order to exploit the full functionality of the
*AnnData-Scanpy-Squidpy* ecosystem.

# Spatial coordinates in AnnData
# ------------------------------
# First, let's generate some data. We will need:
#
#   - an array of features (e.g. counts).
#   - an array of spatial coordinates.
#   - an image array (e.g. the tissue image).
rng = default_rng(42)
counts = rng.integers(0, 15, size=(10, 100))  # feature matrix
coordinates = rng.uniform(0, 10, size=(10, 2))  # spatial coordinates
image = rng.uniform(0, 1, size=(10, 10, 3))  # image

###############################################################################
# Let's first start with creating the :class:`anndata.AnnData` object.
# We will first just use the count matrix and the spatial coordinates.
# Specify the :attr:`anndata.AnnData.obsm` key as `'spatial'` is not strictly necessary
# but will save you a lot of typing since it's the default for both Squidpy and Scanpy.
adata = AnnData(counts, obsm={"spatial": coordinates})

###############################################################################
# Next, let's run a standard Scanpy clustering and umap workflow.
sc.pp.normalize_total(adata)
sc.pp.log1p(adata)
sc.pp.pca(adata)
sc.pp.neighbors(adata)
sc.tl.umap(adata)
sc.tl.leiden(adata)
adata

###############################################################################
# We can visualize the dummy cluster annotation ``adata.obs['leiden']`` in space.
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="leiden", spot_size=1)

###############################################################################
# Tissue image in AnnData
# -----------------------
# For use cases where there is no tissue image, this is all you need
# to start using Scanpy/Squidpy for your analysis.
# For instance, you can compute a spatial graph with :func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`
# based on a fixed neighbor radius that is informative given your experimental settings.
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, radius=3.0)
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="leiden", neighbors_key="spatial_neighbors", spot_size=1, edges=True, edges_width=2)

###############################################################################
# In case you do have an image of the tissue (or multiple, at different resolutions)
# this is what you need to know to correctly store it in AnnData.
# First, let's visualize the mock image from before.
plt.imshow(image)

###############################################################################
# The image and its metadata are stored in the `uns` slot of :class:`anndata.AnnData`.
# Specifically, in the ``adata.uns['spatial'][<library_id>]`` slot, where `library_id`
# is any unique key that refers to the tissue image.
#
# For now, we will assume that there is only one image. This is the necessary metadata:
#
#   - `tissue_hires_scalef` - this is the scale factor between the spatial coordinates
#     units and the image pixels. In the case of Visium, this is usually ~0.17. In this case,
#     we assume that the spatial coordinates are in the same scale of the pixels, and so
#     we will set this value to 1.
#   - `spot_diameter_fullres` - this is the diameter of the capture area for each observation.
#     In the case of Visium, we usually call them `"spots"` and this value is set to ~89.
#
# Here, we will set it to 0.5.
spatial_key = "spatial"

adata.uns[spatial_key][library_id]["scalefactors"] = {"tissue_hires_scalef": 1, "spot_diameter_fullres": 0.5}

###############################################################################
# We don't provide the flexibility (yet) to change the values of such keys.
# These are the keys provided by the Space Ranger output from 10x Genomics Visium
# and therefore were the first to be adopted. In the future, we might settle to
# a sightly different structure.
# But for now, if all such key are correct, :func:`scanpy.pl.spatial` works out of the box.
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="leiden")

###############################################################################
# You can fiddle around with the settings to see what changes.
# For instance, let's change `tissue_hires_scalef` to half the previous value.
adata.uns[spatial_key][library_id]["scalefactors"] = {"tissue_hires_scalef": 0.5, "spot_diameter_fullres": 0.5}
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="leiden")

###############################################################################
# As you can see, the spatial coordinates have been scaled down, and the image
# was "zoomed in".
#
# Of course, you might want to "analyze" such image. :class:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer`
# comes to the rescue! Just instantiate a new object and it will work out of the box.
img = sq.im.ImageContainer(image)
