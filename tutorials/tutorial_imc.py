Imaging Mass Cytometry
======================
This tutorial shows how to apply Squidpy to Imaging Mass Cytometry data.
The data used here comes from a recent paper from
`Jackson et al. <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1876-x>`_.
We provide a pre-processed subset of the data, in :class:`anndata.AnnData` format,
that can be downloaded `here <TODO>`_.
For details on how it was pre-processed, please refer to the original paper.

Import packages & data
----------------------
To run the notebook locally, create a conda environment as *conda create -f environment.yml* using this
`environment.yml <https://github.com/theislab/squidpy_notebooks/blob/master/environment.yml>`_
"""

import scanpy as sc
import squidpy as sq

sc.logging.print_header()
print(f"squidpy=={sq.__version__}")

# load the pre-processed dataset
adata = sq.datasets.imc()

# First, let's visualize cluster annotation in spatial context
# with `scanpy.pl.spatial <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/scanpy.pl.spatial.html>`_ .

sc.pl.spatial(adata, color="cell type", spot_size=10)

###############################################################################
# We can appreciate how the majority of the tissue seems
# to consist of "apoptotic tumor cells". There also seems to be other
# cell types scattered across the tissue of, annotated as "T cells",
# "Macrophages" and different types of "Stromal cells". We can also
# appreciate how a subset of tumor cell, "basal CK tumor cells" seems
# to be located in the lower part of the tissue.

# Co-occurrence across spatial dimensions
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# In addition to the neighbor enrichment score, we can visualize cluster
# co-occurrence in spatial dimensions. This is a similar analysis of the
# one presented above, yet it does not operates on the connectivity matrix,
# yet on the original spatial coordinates. The co-occurrence score is defined as:
# \begin{equation*}
# \frac{p(exp|cond)}{p(exp)}
# \end{equation*}
#
# where $p(exp|cond)$ is the conditional probability of observing a
# cluster $exp$ conditioned on the presence of a cluster $cond$, whereas
# $p(exp)$ is the probability of observing $exp$ in the radius size
# of interest. The score is computed across increasing radii size
# around each cell in the tissue.
#
# We are gonna compute such score with :func:`squidpy.gr.co_occurrence`
# and set the cluster annotation for the conditional probability with
# the argument `clusters`. Then, we visualize the results with
# :func:`squidpy.pl.co_occurrence`.
# We visualize the result for two conditional groups, namely
# "basal CK tumor cell" and "T cells".

sq.gr.co_occurrence(adata, cluster_key="cell type")
sq.pl.co_occurrence(
    adata,
    cluster_key="cell type",
    clusters=["basal CK tumor cell", "T cells"],
    figsize=(15, 4),
)

###############################################################################
# We can observer that *T cells* seems to co-occur
# with *endothelial* and *vimentin hi stromal cells*,
# whereas *basal CK tumor cell* seem to largely cluster
# together, except for the presence of a type of stromal
# cells (*small elongated stromal cell*) at close distance.

###############################################################################
# Neighborhood enrichment
# +++++++++++++++++++++++
# A similar analysis that can inform on the neighbor structure of
# the tissue is the *neighborhood enrichment test*.
# You can compute such score with the following function: :func:`squidpy.gr.nhood_enrichment`.
# In short, it's an enrichment score on spatial proximity of clusters:
# if spots belonging to two different clusters are often close to each other,
# then they will have a high score and can be defined as being *enriched*.
# On the other hand, if they are far apart, the score will be low
# and they can be defined as *depleted*.
# This score is based on a permutation-based test, and you can set
# the number of permutations with the `n_perms` argument (default is 1000).
#
# Since the function works on a connectivity matrix, we need to compute that as well.
# This can be done with :func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`.
# Please see #ADD LINK for a thorough explanation of how this function works.
#
# Finally, we'll directly visualize the results with :func:`squidpy.pl.nhood_enrichment`.

sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata)
sq.gr.nhood_enrichment(adata, cluster_key="cell type")
sq.pl.nhood_enrichment(adata, cluster_key="cell type")

###############################################################################
# Interestingly, "T cells" shows an enrichment with "stromal"  and
# "endothelial cells", as well as "macrophages". Another interesting
# result is that "apoptotic tumor cells", being uniformly spread across
# the tissue area, show a neighbor depletion against any other cluster
# (but a strong enrichment for itself). This is a correct interpretation
# from a permutation based approach, because the cluster annotation,
# being uniformly spread across the tissue, and in high number, it's
# more likely to be enriched with cell types from the same class,
# rather than different one.

###############################################################################
# Interaction matrix and network centralities
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Squidpy provides other descriptive statistics of the spatial graph.
# For instance, the interaction matrix, which counts the number of edges
# that each cluster share with all the others.
# This score can be computed with the function :func:`squidpy.gr.interaction_matrix`.
# We can visualize the results with  :func:`squidpy.pl.interaction_matrix`.


sq.gr.interaction_matrix(adata, cluster_key="cell type")
sq.pl.interaction_matrix(adata, cluster_key="cell type")


###############################################################################
# Finally, similar to the previous analysis,
# we can investigate properties of the spatial graph by
# computing different network centralities:
# - degree_centrality
# - average_clustering
# - closeness_centrality
#
# Squidpy provides a convenient function for all of them:
# :func:`squidpy.gr.centrality_scores` and
# :func:`squidpy.pl.centrality_scores` for visualization.

sq.gr.centrality_scores(
    adata,
    cluster_key="cell type",
)
sq.pl.centrality_scores(adata, cluster_key="cell type", figsize=(20, 5), s=500)


###############################################################################
# You can familiarize yourself with network centralities from the
# excellent networkx
# `documentation <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/centrality>`_ .
# For the purpose of this analysis, we can appreciate that the "apoptotic tumor cell"
# clusters shows high closeness centrality, indicating that nodes belonging to that group
# are often close to each other in the spatial graph.
