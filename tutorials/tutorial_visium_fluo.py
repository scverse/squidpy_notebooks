Visium Fluorescence dataset
===========================
This tutorial shows how to apply Squidpy for the analysis of Visium spatial transcriptomics dataset
with a focus on extracting image features.

For a tutorial using Visium data that includes the graph analysis functions, have a look at
:func:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_visium_hne.py`.
The dataset used here consists of a Visium slide of a coronal section of the mouse brain.
The original dataset is publicly available at the
10x genomics `dataset portal <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets>`_ .
Here, we provide a pre-processed dataset, with pre-annotated clusters, in :class:`anndata.AnnData` format and the
tissue image in :class:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer` format.

A couple of notes on pre-processing:

- The pre-processing pipeline is the same as the one shown in the original
  `Scanpy tutorial <https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spatial/basic-analysis.html>`_ .
- The cluster annotation was performed using several resources, such as the
  `Allen Brain Atlas <http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/thumbnails/100048576?image_type=atlas>`_ ,
  the `Mouse Brain gene expression atlas <http://mousebrain.org/genesearch.html>`_
  from the Linnarson lab and this recent `preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.24.219758v1>`_ .

Import packages & data
----------------------
To run the notebook locally, create a conda environment as *conda create -f environment.yml* using this
`environment.yml <https://github.com/theislab/squidpy_notebooks/blob/master/environment.yml>`_

# Visium datasets contain high-resolution images of the tissue that was used for the gene extraction.
# Using the function :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features` you can calculate image features
# for each Visium spot and create a ``obs x features`` matrix in ``adata`` that can then be analyzed together
# with the ``obs x gene`` gene expression matrix.
#
# By extracting image features we are aiming to get both similar and complementary information to the
# gene expression values.
# Similar information is for example present in the case of a tissue with two different cell types
# whose morphology is different.
# Such cell type information is then contained in both the gene expression values and the tissue image features.
# Complementary or additional information is present in the fact that we can use a nucleus segmentation
# to count cells and add features summarizing the immediate spatial neighborhood of a spot.
#
# Squidpy contains several feature extractors and a flexible pipeline of calculating features
# of different scales and sizes.
# There are several detailed examples of how to use :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_features.py` provides a good starting point for learning more.
#
# Here, we will extract `summary`, `histogram`, `segmentation`, and `texture` features.
# To provide more context and allow the calculation of multi-scale features, we will additionally calculate
# `summary` and `histogram` features at different crop sizes and scales.
#
# Image Segmentation
# ------------------
# To calculate `segmentation` features, we first need to segment the tissue image using :func:`squidpy.im.segment_img`.
# For this we use the DAPI channel if the fluorescence image (``channel_ids=0``).
# Please refer to :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segment_fluo.py`
# for more details on how to calculate a segmented image.

sq.im.segment_img(img=img, img_id="image", model_group="watershed", channel_ids=0, thresh=40000, xs=1000, ys=1000)

# plot the resulting segmentation
img_crop = img.crop_corner(2000, 2000, 500, 500)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(img_crop["image"][:, :, 0])
axes[1].imshow(img_crop["segmented_watershed"] > 0, interpolation="none")

###############################################################################
# The result of :func:`squidpy.im.segment_img` is saved in ``img['segmented_watershed']``.
# It is a label image where each segmented object is annotated with a different integer number.
#
# Segmentation Features
# ---------------------
# We can now use the segmentation to calculate segmentation features.
# These include morphological features of the segmented objects and channel-wise image
# intensities beneath the segmentation mask.
# In particular, we can count the segmented objects within each Visium spot to get an
# approximation of the number of cells.
# In addition, we can calculate the mean intensity of each fluorescence channel within the segmented objects.
# Depending on the fluorescence channels, this can give us e.g. an estimation of the cell type.
# For more details on how the segmentation features, you can have a look at
# :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segmentation_features.py`.

# Above, we made use of :func:`squidpy.pl.extract`, a method to extract
# all features in a given `adata.obsm['{key}']` and temporarily save them to :attr:`anndata.AnnData.obs`.
# Such method is particularly useful for plotting purpose, as showed above.
#
# The number of cells per Visium spot provides an interesting view of the data that can enhance
# the characterization of gene-space clusters.
# We can see that the cell-rich pyramidal layer of the Hippocampus has more cells than the surrounding areas
# (upper left).
# This fine-grained view of the Hippocampus is not visible in the gene clusters where
# the Hippocampus is one cluster only.
#
# The per-channel intensities plotted in the second row show us that the areas labeled with *Cortex_1* and
# *Cortex_3* have a higher intensity of channel 1, anti-NEUN (lower left).
# This means that these areas have more neurons that the remaining areas in this crop.
# In addition, cluster *Fiber_tracts* and *lateral ventricles* seems to be enriched with Glial cells,
# seen by the larger mean intensities of channel 2, anti-GFAP, in these areas (lower right).

# Extract and cluster features

# Like the gene-space clusters (bottom middle), the feature space clusters are also spatially coherent.
#
# The feature clusters of the different feature extractors are quite diverse, but all of them reflect
# the structure of the hippocampus by assigning different clusters to the different structural areas.
# This is a higher level of detail than the gene-space clustering provides with only one cluster for the hippocampus.
#
# The feature clusters also show the layered structure of the cortex, but again subdividing it in more clusters
# than the gene-space clustering.
# It might be possible to re-cluster the gene expression counts with a higher resolution to also get
# more fine-grained clusters, but nevertheless the image features seem to provide additional supporting
# information to the gene-space clusters.
