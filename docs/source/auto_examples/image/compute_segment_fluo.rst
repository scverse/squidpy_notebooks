Cell-segmentation for fluorescence images
-----------------------------------------

This example shows how to use the high resolution tissue images to segment nuclei.

This information can be used to compute additional image features like cell count and cell size per spot
(see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segmentation_features.py`).
This example shows how to use :func:`squidpy.im.segment` and explains the parameters you can use.

We provide two segmentation models :class:`squidpy.im.SegmentationWatershed`
and :class:`squidpy.im.SegmentationBlob`.
In addition, you can use a custom segmentation function, like a pre-trained :mod:`tensorflow.keras` model,
to perform the segmentation utilizing :class:`squidpy.im.SegmentationCustom`.

Note that when using the provided segmentation models `'blob'` and `'watershed'`, the quality of the
cell-segmentation depends on the quality of your tissue images.
In this example we use the DAPI stain of a fluorescence dataset to compute the segmentation.
For harder cases, you may want to provide your own pre-trained segmentation model.

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segment_hne.py` for an example on how to
    calculate a cell-segmentation of an H&E stain.

We crop the image to a smaller segment.
This is only to speed things up, :func:`squidpy.im.segment` can also process very large images
(see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_process_hires.py`.)

The tissue image in this dataset contains four fluorescence stains.
The first one is DAPI, which we will use for the nuclei-segmentation.

We segment the image with :func:`squidpy.im.segment` using watershed segmentation
(``method="watershed"``).
With the arguments ``layer`` and ``channel`` we define the image layer and
channel of the image that should be segmented.

With ``kwargs`` we can provide keyword arguments to the segmentation model.
For watershed segmentation, we need to set a threshold to create the mask image.
You can either set a manual threshold, or use automated
`Otsu thresholding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method>`_.
For this fluorescence image example, Otsu's thresh works very well,
thus we will use ``thresh = None``.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segment_hne.py`
for an example where we use a manually defined threshold.

In addition, we can specify if the values greater or equal than
the threshold should be in the mask (default)
or if the values smaller to the threshold should be in the mask (``geq = False``).

The segmented crop is saved in the layer ``segmented_watershed``.
This behavior can be changed with the arguments ``copy`` and ``layer_added``.
The result of the segmentation is a label image that can be used to extract features like the
number of cells from the image.
