Process a high-resolution image
-------------------------------

This example shows how to use :func:`squidpy.im.process` with tiling.

The function can be applied to any method (e.g., smoothing, conversion to grayscale)
or ``layer`` of a high-resolution image layer of :class:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer`.

By default, :func:`squidpy.im.process` processes the entire input image at once.
In the case of high-resolution tissue slides however, the images might be too big to fit in memory
and cannot be processed at once.
In that case you can use the argument ``chunks`` to tile the image in crops of shape ``chunks``,
process each crop, and re-assemble the resulting image.
Note that you can also use :func:`squidpy.im.segment` in this manner.

Note that depending on the processing function used, there might be border effects occurring at the edges
of the crops.
Since Squidpy is backed by :mod:`dask`, and internally chunking is done using :func:`dask.array.map_overlap`,
dealing with these border effects is easy.
Just specify the ``depth`` and ``boundary`` arguments in the ``apply_kwargs``
upon the call to :func:`squidpy.im.process`.
For more information, please refer to the documentation of :func:`dask.array.map_overlap`.

For the build in processing functions, `gray` and `smooth`, the border effects are already automatically
taken care of, so it is not necessary to specify ``depth`` and ``boundary``.
For :func:`squidpy.im.segment`, the default ``depth`` is 30, which already takes care of most severe
border effects.

We will process the image by tiling it in crops of shape ``chunks = (1000, 1000)``.

Now we can look at the result on a cropped part of the image.

    _ = axes[0].set_title("original")
    crop.show("image_gray", cmap="gray", ax=axes[1])
    _ = axes[1].set_title("grayscale")

Custom processing functions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here, we use a custom processing function (here :func:`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter`)
with chunking to showcase the ``depth`` and ``boundary`` arguments.

Lets use a simple image and choose the chunk size in such a way to clearly see the differences
between using overlapping crops and non-overlapping crops.

.. code-block:: default

    arr = np.zeros((20, 20))
    arr[10:] = 1
    img = sq.im.ImageContainer(arr, layer="image")

    # smooth the image using `depth` 0 and 1
    sq.im.process(
        img,
        layer="image",
        method=gaussian_filter,
        layer_added="smooth_depth0",
        chunks=10,
        sigma=1,
        apply_kwargs={"depth": 0},
    )
    sq.im.process(
        img,
        layer="image",
        method=gaussian_filter,
        layer_added="smooth_depth1",
        chunks=10,
        sigma=1,
        apply_kwargs={"depth": 1, "boundary": "reflect"},
    )

Plot the difference in results.
Using overlapping blocks with ``depth = 1`` removes the artifacts at the borders between chunks.
