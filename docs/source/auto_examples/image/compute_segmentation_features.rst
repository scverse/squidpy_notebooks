Extract segmentation features
-----------------------------

This example shows how to extract segmentation features from the tissue image.

Features extracted from a nucleus segmentation range from the number of nuclei per image,
over nuclei shapes and sizes, to the intensity of the input channels within the segmented objects.
They are very interpretable features and provide valuable additional information.
Use ``features='segmentation'`` to calculate the features.

In addition to ``feature_name`` and ``channels`` we can specify the following ``features_kwargs``:

- ``label_layer`` - name of label image layer in ``img``.
- ``props`` - segmentation features that are calculated. See `properties` in :func:`skimage.measure.regionprops_table`.

.. seealso::

      on calculating a cell-segmentation.
    - :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_features.py` for the general usage of
      :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.

Lets load a fluorescence Visium dataset.

Before calculating segmentation features, we need to first calculate a segmentation
using :func:`squidpy.im.segment`.

    sq.im.segment(img=img, layer="image", layer_added="segmented_watershed", method="watershed", channel=0)

Now we can calculate segmentation features. Here, we will calculate the following features:

- number of nuclei (``label``).
- mean area of nuclei (``area``).
- mean intensity of channels 1 (anti-NEUN) and 2 (anti-GFAP) within nuclei (``mean_intensity``).

We use ``mask_cicle = True`` to ensure that we are only extracting features from the tissue underneath
each Visium spot. For more details on the image cropping, see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_crops.py`.

Use :func:`squidpy.pl.extract` to plot the texture features on the tissue image or have a look at
`our interactive visualisation tutorial <../../external_tutorials/tutorial_napari.ipynb>`_ to learn
how to use our interactive :mod:`napari` plugin.
Here, we show all calculated segmentation features.

`segmentation_label` shows the number of nuclei per spot and `segmentation_area_mean` the mean are of nuclei per spot.
The remaining two plots show the mean intensity of channels 1 and 2 per spot.
As the stains for channels 1 and 2 are specific to Neurons and Glial cells, respectively,
these features show us Neuron and Glial cell dense areas.
