Extract Image Features
======================
This example explains the computation of spot-wise features from visium images.

Visium datasets contain high-resolution images of the tissue in addition to the spatial gene expression
measurements per spot (`obs`).
In this notebook, we extract features for each spot from an image using :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`
and create a ``obs x features`` matrix that can be analysed together with
the ``obs x genes`` spatial gene expression matrix.

We provide different feature extractors that are described in more detail in the following examples:

- summary statistics of each color channel
  (:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_summary_features.py`)
- texture features based on repeating patterns
  (:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_texture_features.py`)
- color histogram features using counts in bins of each channel's histogram
  (:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_histogram_features.py`)
- number and size of objects from a binary segmentation layer
  (:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_segmentation_features.py`)

The high-resolution tissue image is contained in ``img['image']``,
and the spot locations coordinates are stored in ``adata.obsm['spatial']``.
We can plot the spots overlayed on a lower-resolution version of the tissue image contained in adata.

Using this information, we can now extract features from the tissue underneath each spot by calling
:func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.
This function takes both ``adata`` and ``img`` as input, and will write the resulting ``obs x features`` matrix to
``adata.obsm[key]``.
It contains several arguments to modify its behaviour.
With these arguments you can

- specify the image used for feature calculation using ``img_id``,
- specify the type of features that should be calculated using ``features`` and ``features_kwargs``,
- specify how the crops used for feature calculation look like using ``kwargs``,
- specify parallelization options using ``n_jobs``, ``backend``, and ``show_progress_bar``,
- specify how the data that is returned using ``key_added`` and ``copy``.

Let us first calculate summary features and save the result in ``adata.obsm['features']``.

To visualize the features, we can use :func:`squidpy.pl.extract` to plot the texture features on the tissue image.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plotting_compute_extract.py` for more details on this function.

Here, we plot the median values of all channels (`summary_quantile_0.5_ch_0`, `summary_quantile_0.5_ch_1` and
`summary_quantile_0.5_ch_2`).

Specify crop appearance
-----------------------
Features are extracted from image crops that capture the visium spots
(see also :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_crops.py`).
By default, the crops have the same size as the spot, are not scaled and square.
We can use the ``mask_circle`` argument to mask a circle and ensure that only tissue underneath the round
visium spots is taken into account to compute the features.
Further, we can set ``scale`` and ``size`` arguments to change how the crops are generated.
For more details on the crop computation, see also :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_crops.py`.

- Use ``mask_circle=True, scale=1, size=1``, if you would like to get features that are calculated only from tissue
  in a visium spot
- Use ``scale=X``, with `X < 1`, if you would like to downscale the crop before extracting the features
- Use ``size=X``, with `X > 1`, if you would like to extract crops that are X-times the size of the visium spot

Let us extract masked and scaled features and compare them
