Building spatial neighbors graph
--------------------------------

This example shows how to compute a spatial neighbors graph.

Spatial graph is a graph of spatial neighbors with observations as nodes
and neighbor-hood relations between observations as edges.
We use spatial coordinates of spots/cells to identify neighbors among them.
Different approach of defining a neighborhood relation among observations are used
for different types of spatial datasets.

First, we show how to compute the spatial neighbors graph for a Visium dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-26

.. code-block:: default


    adata = sq.datasets.visium_fluo_adata()
    adata


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-33

We use :func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors` for this.
The function expects ``coord_type = 'visium'`` by default.
We set this parameter here explicitly for clarity.
``n_rings`` should be used only for Visium datasets.
It specifies for each spot how many hexagonal rings of spots around
will be considered neighbors.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-36

.. code-block:: default


    sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, n_rings=2, coord_type="visium")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-40

The function builds a spatial graph and saves its adjacency matrix
to ``adata.obsp['spatial_connectivities']`` and weighted adjacency matrix to
``adata.obsp['spatial_distances']`` by default.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-43

.. code-block:: default


    adata.obsp["spatial_connectivities"]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-47

For ``n_rings = 1`` there will be no ``adata.obsp['spatial_distances']``
The weights of the weighted adjacency matrix are ordinal numbers of hexagonal rings
in the case of ``coord_type = 'visium'``.

.. code-block:: default


    adata.obsp["spatial_distances"]


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

We can visualize the neighbors of a point to better visualize what `n_rings` mean:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-63

.. code-block:: default


    _, idx = adata.obsp["spatial_connectivities"][420, :].nonzero()
    idx = np.append(idx, 420)
    sc.pl.spatial(
        adata[idx, :],
        neighbors_key="spatial_neighbors",
        edges=True,
        edges_width=1,
        img_key=None,
    )


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-65

Next, we show how to compute the spatial neighbors graph for a non-Visium dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-69

.. code-block:: default


    adata = sq.datasets.imc()
    adata


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-73

We use the same function for this with ``coord_type = 'generic'``.
``n_neigh`` and ``radius`` can be used for non-Visium datasets.
``n_neigh`` specifies a fixed number of the closest spots for each spot as neighbors.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-87

.. code-block:: default


    sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, n_neigh=10, coord_type="generic")
    _, idx = adata.obsp["spatial_connectivities"][420, :].nonzero()
    idx = np.append(idx, 420)
    sc.pl.spatial(
        adata[idx, :],
        color="cell type",
        neighbors_key="spatial_neighbors",
        spot_size=1,
        edges=True,
        edges_width=1,
        img_key=None,
    )


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-90

In order to get all spots within a specified radius (in units of the spatial coordinates)
from each spot as neighbors, the parameter ``radius`` should be used.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-95

.. code-block:: default


    sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, radius=0.3, coord_type="generic")
