Compute Co-occurrence probability
---------------------------------

This example shows how to compute the co-occurrence probability.

The co-occurrence score is defined as:

.. math::
    \frac{p(exp|cond)}{p(exp)}

where :math:`p(exp|cond)` is the conditional probability of observing a cluster :math:`exp` conditioned
on the presence
of a cluster :math:`cond`, whereas :math:`p(exp)` is the probability of observing :math:`exp` in the
radius size of interest.
The score is computed across increasing radii size around each cell in the tissue.

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_ripley_k.py` for
    another score to describe spatial patterns with :func:`squidpy.gr.ripley_k`.

We can compute the co-occurrence score with :func:`squidpy.gr.co_occurrence`.
Results can be visualized with :func:`squidpy.pl.co_occurrence`.
