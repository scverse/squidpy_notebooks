The score is computed across increasing radii size around each\ncell in the tissue.\n\nWe can compute this score with `squidpy.gr.co_occurrence` and set the\ncluster annotation for the conditional probability with the argument\n`clusters`.

You can compute such score\nwith the following function: `squidpy.gr.nhood_enrichment`. In short,\nit\\'s an enrichment score on spatial proximity of clusters: if spots\nbelonging to two different clusters are often close to each other, then\nthey will have a high score and can be defined as being *enriched*. On\nthe other hand, if they are far apart, the score will be low and they\ncan be defined as *depleted*. This score is based on a permutation-based\ntest, and you can set the number of permutations with the `n_perms`\nargument (default is 1000).\n\nSince the function works on a connectivity matrix, we need to compute\nthat as well. This can be done with `squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`.\nPlease see `sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_spatial_neighbors.py`\nfor more details of how this function works.\n\nFinally, we visualize the results with `squidpy.pl.nhood_enrichment`.\n"
