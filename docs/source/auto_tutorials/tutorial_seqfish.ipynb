        "# Neighborhood enrichment analysis\n\nSimilar to other spatial data, we can investigate spatial organization\nof clusters in a quantitative way, by computing a neighborhood\nenrichment score. You can compute such score with the following\nfunction: `squidpy.gr.nhood_enrichment`. In short, it\\'s an enrichment\nscore on spatial proximity of clusters: if spots belonging to two\ndifferent clusters are often close to each other, then they will have a\nhigh score and can be defined as being *enriched*. On the other hand, if\nthey are far apart, the score will be low and they can be defined as\n*depleted*. This score is based on a permutation-based test, and you can\nset the number of permutations with the [n_perms]{.title-ref} argument\n(default is 1000).\n\nSince the function works on a connectivity matrix, we need to compute\nthat as well. This can be done with `squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`.\nPlease see `sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_spatial_neighbors.py`\nfor more details of how this function works.\n\nFinally, we\\'ll directly visualize the results with\n`squidpy.pl.nhood_enrichment`. We\\'ll add a dendrogram to the heatmap\ncomputed with linkage method *ward*.\n"
