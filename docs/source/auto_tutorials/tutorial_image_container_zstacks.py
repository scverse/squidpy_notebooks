Use z-stacks with ImageContainer
================================
In this example we showcase how to use z-stacks with :class:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer`

It is possible to acquire several consecutive image slices from the same tissue.
Squidpy's `ImageContainer` supports storing, processing, and visualization of these z-stacks.

Here, we use the Visium 10x mouse brain sagittal slices as an example of a z-stack image with two Z dimensions.
We will use the "hires" images contained in the :class:`anndata.AnnData` object, but you could also use the
original resolution tiff images in the `ImageContainer`.

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_tutorial_image_container.py` for a general introduction to the `ImageContainer`.

# Concatenate per-section data to a z-stack
# -----------------------------------------
# To allow mapping from observations in `adata` to the correct Z dimension in `img`,
# we will store a ``library_id`` column in ``adata.obs`` and associate each ``library_id``
# to a Z dimension in the `ImageContainer`.
#
# For this, we will use :func:`anndata.concat` with ``uns_merge = only``
# (to ensure that `uns` entries are correctly concatenated),
# ``label = 'library_id'`` and ``keys = library_ids`` (to create the necessary column in ``adata.obs``.
#
# To concatenate the individual :class:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer`,
# we will use :meth:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer.concat`, specifying
# ``library_ids = library_ids`` for associating each image with the correct observations in `adata`.
adata = ad.concat(adatas, uns_merge="only", label="library_id", keys=library_ids, index_unique="-")
img = sq.im.ImageContainer.concat(imgs, library_ids=library_ids)

###############################################################################
# `adata` now contains a ``library_id`` column in ``adata.obs``, which maps observations to a unique `library_id`.
print(adata)
adata.obs

###############################################################################
# `img` contains the 2D images concatenated along the Z dimension in one image layer.
# The Z dimensions are named the same as the `library_id`'s in `adata` to allow a mapping from `adata` to `img`.
print(img["image"].z)
img

###############################################################################
# It is also possible to initialize the `ImageContainer` with images that already contain the Z dimension.
# In this case you need to specify the ``library_id`` argument in the constructor.
# In addition, you might want to set ``dims`` to the correct ordering of dimensions manually for more control.
arr = img["image"].values
print(arr.shape)
img2 = sq.im.ImageContainer(arr, library_id=library_ids, dims=("y", "x", "z", "channels"))

###############################################################################
# Generally, an `ImageContainer` with more than one Z dimension can be used in the same way as an `ImageContainer`
# with only one Z dimension.
# In addition, we can specify `library_id` to cropping, pre-processing,
# and segmentation functions if we'd like to only process a specific `library_id`.

###############################################################################
# Visualization
# -------------
# For using :func:`scanpy.pl.spatial`, subset the `adata` to the desired `library_id`.
library_id = library_ids[0]
sc.pl.spatial(adata[adata.obs["library_id"] == library_id], library_id=library_id, color="in_tissue")

###############################################################################
# :meth:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer.show` works with z-stacks out of the box, by plotting them as separate images.
# Additionally, you can specify a `library_id` if you only want to plot one Z dimension.
img.show()

###############################################################################
# Interactive visualization of z-stacks is also possible.
# The Napari viewer will have a slider at the bottom, allowing you to choose the Z dimension to display.
# The `adata` observations are automatically updated to the current Z dimension.
#
# When calling ``img.interactive`` just specify ``library_key`` as the column name in ``adata.obs``
# which maps from observations to `library_ids`
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    img.interactive(adata, library_key='library_id')

###############################################################################
# Cropping
# --------
# By default, the cropping functions will crop all Z dimensions.
crop = img.crop_corner(500, 1000, size=500)

###############################################################################
# You can also specify ``library_id``, as either a single or multiple Z dimensions to crop.

###############################################################################
# Processing and segmenting
# -------------------------
# Let us smooth the image.
# When not specifying a `library_id`, :func:`squidpy.im.process` treats the image as a 3D volume.
# As we would like to smooth only in x and y dimensions, and not in z, we need so specify a per-dimension `sigma`.
# The internal dimensions of the image are ``y, x, z, channels``, as you can check with ``crop['image'].dims``.
# Therefore, to only smooth in x and y, we need to specify ``sigma = [10, 10, 0, 0]``.
sq.im.process(img, layer="image", method="smooth", sigma=[10, 10, 0, 0], layer_added="smooth1")
img.show("smooth1")

###############################################################################
# Now, let us just smooth one `library_id`.
# Specifying `library_id` means that the processing function will process each Z dimension separately.
# This means that now the dimensions of the processed image are ``y, x, channels`` (with ``z`` removed), meaning that
# we have to update `sigma` accordingly.
# If the number of channels does not change due to the processing, :func:`squidpy.im.process` implies the identity
# function for non-processed Z dimensions.
sq.im.process(img, layer="image", method="smooth", sigma=10, layer_added="smooth2", library_id=library_ids[0])
img.show("smooth2")

###############################################################################
# None, only the first `library_id` is smoothed.
# For the second, the original image was used.
#
# If the processing function changes the number of dimensions, non-processed Z dimensions will contain 0.
# Let's see this behavior with using ``method = 'gray'``, which moves from 3 channels (RGB) to one channel (gray).
sq.im.process(img, layer="image", method="gray", layer_added="gray", library_id=library_ids[0])
img.show("gray", cmap="gray")

###############################################################################
# :func:`squidpy.im.segment` works in the same way, just specify `library_id` if you only wish to
# segment specific Z dimensions.
#
# Feature calculation
# -------------------
# Calculating features from z-stack images is straight forward as well.
# With more than one Z dimension, we just need to specify the column name in ``adata.obs``
# which contains the mapping from observations to `library_ids`
# to allow the function to extract the features from the correct Z dimension.
# As of now, features can only be extracted on 2D, meaning from the Z dimension that the current spot is located on.
#
# The following call extracts features for each observation in `adata`, automatically choosing the correct
# Z dimension in `img`.
adata_crop = crop.subset(adata)  # subset adata to the image crop
sq.im.calculate_image_features(adata_crop, crop, library_id="library_id", layer="image", features="summary", n_jobs=4)
adata_crop.obsm["img_features"]

###############################################################################
# The calculated features can now be used in downstream Scanpy analyses, by e.g. using all Z dimensions
# to cluster spots based on image features and gene features.
#
# Here, we cluster genes and calculated features using a standard Scanpy workflow.
