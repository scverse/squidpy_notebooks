Analyze Slide-seqV2 data
========================

This tutorial shows how to apply Squidpy for the analysis of Slide-seqV2 data.

The data used here was obtained from :cite:`Stickels2020-rf`.
We provide a pre-processed subset of the data, in :class:`anndata.AnnData` format.
We would like to thank @tudaga for providing cell-type level annotation.
For details on how it was pre-processed, please refer to the original paper.

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_tutorial_visium_hne.py` and
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_tutorial_seqfish.py` for additional analysis examples.

Import packages & data
----------------------
To run the notebook locally, create a conda environment as *conda env create -f environment.yml* using this
`environment.yml <https://github.com/theislab/squidpy_notebooks/blob/master/environment.yml>`_.

Neighborhood enrichment analysis
--------------------------------
Similar to other spatial data, we can investigate spatial organization of clusters
in a quantitative way, by computing a neighborhood enrichment score.
You can compute such score with the following function: :func:`squidpy.gr.nhood_enrichment`.
In short, it's an enrichment score on spatial proximity of clusters:
if spots belonging to two different clusters are often close to each other,
then they will have a high score and can be defined as being *enriched*.
On the other hand, if they are far apart, the score will be low
and they can be defined as *depleted*.
This score is based on a permutation-based test, and you can set
the number of permutations with the `n_perms` argument (default is 1000).

Since the function works on a connectivity matrix, we need to compute that as well.
This can be done with :func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`.
Please see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_spatial_neighbors.py` and
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_nhood_enrichment.py` for more details
of how these functions works.

Finally, we'll directly visualize the results with :func:`squidpy.pl.nhood_enrichment`.
We'll add a dendrogram to the heatmap computed with linkage method *ward*.

Interestingly, there seems to be an enrichment between the *Endothelial_Tip*,
the *Ependymal* cells. Another putative enrichment is between the *Oligodendrocytes*

Ripley's statistics
-------------------
In addition to the neighbor enrichment score, we can further investigate spatial
organization of cell types in tissue by means of the Ripley's statistics.
Ripley's statistics allow analyst to evaluate whether a discrete annotation (e.g. cell-type)
appears to be clustered, dispersed or randomly distributed on the area of interest.
In Squidpy, we implement three closely related Ripley's statistics, that can be
easily computed with :func:`squidpy.gr.ripley`. Here, we'll showcase the Ripley's L statistic,
which is a variance-stabilized version of the Ripley's K statistics.
We'll visualize the results with :func:`squidpy.pl.ripley`.
Check :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_ripley.py` for more details.

The plot highlight how some cell-types have a more clustered pattern,
like *Astrocytes* and *CA11_CA2_CA3_Subiculum* cells, whereas other have a more
dispersed pattern, like *Mural* cells. To confirm such interpretation, we can
selectively visualize again their spatial organization.

Ligand-receptor interaction analysis
------------------------------------
The analysis showed above has provided us with quantitative information on
cellular organization and communication at the tissue level.
We might be interested in getting a list of potential candidates that might be driving
such cellular communication.
This naturally translates in doing a ligand-receptor interaction analysis.
In Squidpy, we provide a fast re-implementation the popular method CellPhoneDB :cite:`cellphonedb`
(`code <https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb>`_ )
and extended its database of annotated ligand-receptor interaction pairs with
the popular database *Omnipath* :cite:`omnipath`.
You can run the analysis for all clusters pairs, and all genes (in seconds,
without leaving this notebook), with :func:`squidpy.gr.ligrec`.

Let's perform the analysis and visualize the result for three clusters of
interest: *Polydendrocytes* and *Oligodendrocytes*.
For the visualization, we will filter out annotations
with low-expressed genes (with the ``means_range`` argument)
and decreasing the threshold
for the adjusted p-value (with the ``alpha`` argument)
Check :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_ligrec.py` for more details.

The dotplot visualization provides an interesting set of candidate interactions
that could be involved in the tissue organization of the cell types of interest.
It should be noted that this method is a pure re-implementation of the original
permutation-based test, and therefore retains all its caveats
and should be interpreted accordingly.

Spatially variable genes with spatial autocorrelation statistics
----------------------------------------------------------------
Lastly, with Squidpy we can investigate spatial variability of gene expression.
:func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_autocorr` conveniently wraps two
spatial autocorrelation statistics: *Moran's I* and *Geary's C**.
They provide a score on the degree of spatial variability of gene expression.
The statistic as well as the p-value are computed for each gene, and FDR correction
is performed. For the purpose of this tutorial, let's compute the *Moran's I* score.
See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_graph_compute_moran.py` for more details.
