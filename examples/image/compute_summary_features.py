Summary features
----------------

Here, we use :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features` to extract summary features from the tissue image.

Summary features give a good overview over the intensity of each image channels at the location of the visium spots.
They are calculated by using ``features = 'summary'``,
which will internally call :meth:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer.get_summary_features`.

In addition to ``feature_name`` and ``channels`` we can specify the following ``features_kwargs``:

- ``quantiles``: Quantiles that are computed. By default, the 0.9th, 0.5th, and 0.1th quantiles are calculated

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_features.py` for general usage of
    :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.
