Extract summary features
------------------------

This example shows how to extract summary features from the tissue image.

Summary features give a good overview over the intensity of each image channels at the location of the Visium spots.
They are calculated by using ``features = 'summary'``, which calls :func:`squidpy.im.ImageContainer.features_summary`.

In addition to ``feature_name`` and ``channels`` we can specify the following ``features_kwargs``:

    - ``quantiles`` - quantiles that are computed. By default, the 0.9th, 0.5th, and 0.1th quantiles are calculated.

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_features.py` for general usage of
    :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.

# Then, we calculate the 0.1th quantile, mean and standard deviation for the Visium spots

# In order to get statistics of only the tissue underneath the spots, we use the argument ``mask_circle = True``.
# When not setting this flag, statistics are calculated using a square crop centered on the spot.

# calculate summary features and save in key "summary_features"
