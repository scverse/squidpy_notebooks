Histogram features
------------------

Here, we use :func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features` to extract histogram features from the tissue image.
Have a look at :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_features.py` for the general usage of
:func:`squidpy.im.calculate_image_features`.

Histogram features give a more detailed view than summary features
(:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_image_compute_summary_features.py`)
by computing a histogram of each image channel and returning bin-counts for each visium spot.
Use ``features='histogram'`` to calculate the features.

In addition to ``feature_name`` and ``channels`` we can specify the following ``features_kwargs``:

- ``bins``: Number of bins of the histogram. Default is 10
- ``v_range``: Range on which values are binned. Default is the whole image range

# With these features we can e.g. appreciate the detailed distribution of
# intensity values of channel 0 (DAPI stain) on the different bins.
