Compute Sepal score
-------------------

This example shows how to compute the Sepal score for spatially variable genes identification.

The Sepal score is a method that simulates a diffusion process to quantify spatial structure in tissue.

# We can compute the Sepal score with :func:`squidpy.gr.sepal`.
# there are 2 important aspects to consider when computing sepal:
#
# - The function only accepts grid-like spatial graphs. Make sure to specify the
#   maximum number of neighbors in your data (6 for an hexagonal grid like Visium)
#   with ``max_neighs = 6``.
# - It is useful to filter out genes that are expressed in very few observations
#   and might be wrongly identified as being spatially variable. If you are performing
#   pre-processing with Scanpy, there is a convenient function that can be used BEFORE
#   normalization :func:`scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics`. It computes several useful
#   summary statistics on both observation and feature axis. We will be using the
#   ``n_cells`` columns in `adata.var` to filter out genes that are expressed in
#   less than 100 observations.
#
# Before computing the Sepal score, we first need to compute a spatial graph with :func:`squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors`.
# We will also subset the number of genes to evaluate for efficiency purposes.
