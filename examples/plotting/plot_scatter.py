Plot scatter plot in spatial coordinates
----------------------------------------

This example shows how to use :func:`squidpy.pl.spatial_scatter` to plot annotations and features
stored in :class:`anndata.AnnData`.

This plotting is useful when points and underlying image are available.

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plotting_plot_segment.py` for segmentation masks.

# :func:`squidpy.pl.spatial_scatter` closely resembles :func:`scanpy.pl.spatial`
# but it provides additional functionalities. For instance, with the ```shape``` argument
# it's possible to plot polygons such as square or hexagons, a useful feature when
# technologies other than Visium are used, such as *Dbit-seq*.
# Furthermore, it's also possible to plot a scale bar, where size and pixel units must be passed.
# The size for this example are not the real values and are for purely visualization purposes.

# changing the size of the points as well as the cropping coordinates. To do so,
# lists can be passed to those arguments, with the same number of elements as
# the Visium slides to be plotted. This applies to all elements which could be dataset specific,
